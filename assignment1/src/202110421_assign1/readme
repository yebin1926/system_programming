Assignment Number: 1

Help received from others:
  Searching C syntax, and how to navigate around the server, and understanding shell commands.

Time spent doing the assignment: aprox. 9 hours
Assessment of the assignment: it might have been helpful (for some people) to go over how to navigate around the server (e.g. what each commands mean). 
  It was all written in the ppt but it might've been much easier if we saw how to do it in person, and also because we hadn't learned the meaning shell commands yet. 
  (e.g. what each arrows and 2> mean). But many students have different skill levels so I also see why this wasn't done.
